# PupLife
We have dogs. We love dogs. Most of all, we understand the importance of finding activities and playmates to make your pup happier and eliminate their high amounts of energy at home. If you've got a lonely pup or two at home, look no farther.

This is a social media network for you and your pup!

## MERN App

This full-stack MERN app allows users to communicate and share details of their dog.  Upon signup, the user's information is captured in the MySQL database.  GET, POST and UPDATE routes retrieve and add new data to the databases.

Authentication allows users to access and update their personal profiles which displays reviews posted from previous play dates.
